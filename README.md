## 2. Project Summary
- Device Description
   - The project we designed is called "Smart Bin", which aims to address the issue of inefficient waste management by utilizing humidity and temperature sensor to classify garbage and sort it into appropriate bins. The primary problem it solves is the challenge of separating wet and dry waste effectively, which is crucial for efficient recycling and disposal processes. Meanwhile, in our smart bin system, the automatic sorting process is facilitated by a motor-driven platform that dynamically adjusts to sort garbage based on the detection from the humidity and temperature sensor. When garbage is deposited into the bin, the sensors immediately detect its characteristics, either it is wet or dry. This information triggers the motor to move the platform accordingly, directing the garbage to the appropriate compartment within the bin. For instance, if the sensor detects wet waste, the motor adjusts the platform to direct it towards the wet waste compartment. Conversely, if dry waste is detected, the platform redirects it to the dry waste compartment. The automation aspect of our system significantly reduces the need for manual intervention in sorting waste, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing human effort. Users can simply deposit their waste into the bin without worrying about sorting it themselves, making the process more convenient and user-friendly. Additionally, the automatic sorting mechanism ensures greater accuracy and consistency in waste segregation, minimizing the risk of contamination and improving overall recycling outcomes.
   - The Internet connectivity allows for seamless integration with a user-friendly interface (UI), accessible through web or mobile applications. This UI primarily focuses on displaying real-time data related to the detection of wet or dry levels within the bin. Users can easily monitor the status of the bin, including the current levels of wet and dry waste, as well as historical data for analysis and optimization. In addition to monitoring and control features, our smart bin also incorporates QR code technology in this project. Users can scan a QR code located on the bin to reset its status or perform other maintenance tasks. This QR code functionality simplifies user interaction with the device, eliminating the need for manual inputs or complex procedures.
   - By leveraging the Internet in combination with automatic sorting technology and QR code functionality, our smart bin offers a comprehensive solution for efficient waste management. It not only simplifies waste disposal for users but also enhances operational efficiency and contributes to a more sustainable environment.
